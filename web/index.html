			<h2>
				In Solace of Service, players step into the role of an administrator at a busy
				social service center, where each day presents a new challenge that tests their
				compassion, critical thinking, and resource management skills. The objective is to
				sort individuals from diverse backgrounds based on their specific needs and direct
				them to the appropriate sectors for assistance. This game tests players compassion
				and learning when to step up and help others in need. The experience is both
				demanding and rewarding, as players navigate the complexities of helping others
				while ensuring that no one is left behind.

			<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold pb-2">OUR GOAL</h1>
			<h2>
				Our goal with this project is to create an impactful and meaningful experience
				that goes beyond traditional gameplay. We aim to spread awareness about
				Singapore's diverse social services, which are often underappreciated or
				misunderstood. By immersing players in scenarios where they must identify various
				needs and match them with the right services, we strive to foster not just
				knowledge but a sense of empathy for those who rely on these essential resources.
				We believe that through engaging gameplay and thoughtful storytelling, users can
				better grasp the challenges faced by those in need and the importance of social
				services in supporting them.

			<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold pb-2">WHY VR</h1>
			<h2>
				Utilising the immersive power of virtual reality, the game creates a realistic and
				engaging experience, allowing the players to be absorbed into it. Players are able
				to feel present in the social service centre as they can move about, interacting
				with the game - conversing with the NPCs, signing and stamping paperwork, and
				stepping into the pond. This hands-on approach enhances engagement, making
				learning intuitive and impactful. The use of the Meta Quest series ensures
				seamless player interaction and accessibility, bringing the educational and
				empathy-driven elements to life.
